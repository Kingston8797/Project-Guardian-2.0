## ISCP 2025 – Real-time PII Defense

###  Challenge Overview

This repository contains my solution for the **ISCP 2025 Challenge – Real-time PII Defense (Project Guardian 2.0)**.

The goal was to:

* **Build a PII Detector & Redactor** that scans incoming data records and masks sensitive information without introducing high latency.
* **Provide a deployment strategy** for scaling this defense in a real-world environment.
